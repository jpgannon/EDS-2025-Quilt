# Environmental Data Quilt!

## Overview
This app allows you to take environmental data and turn it into a quilt pattern! Our app provides a unique medium to visualize environmental data. Choose one of the pre-loaded datasets in our app, or upload your own, determine how you would like your data to be displayed on your quilt, chronologically or one year is represented by one row, refine the date range of data that your quilt will include, select how large of a quilt you would like to make, pick a quantity of colors and color scheme for your quilt, and boom! You will be presented with an output where you can view your environmental data quilt design, telling you how many yards of each fabric color you will need to construct your quilt!

## Purpose
Our Environmental Data Quilt App aims to transform complex environmental datasets into tangible, artistic quilt creations. By merging data science with textile arts, our app seeks to make environmental data more accessible and engaging to a broader audience, helping to foster a deeper understanding of and connection to environmental issues. Our app can also be used to reveal trends and patterns that might be overlooked in traditional graphs and charts.
