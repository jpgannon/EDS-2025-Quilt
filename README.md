# Environmental Data Quilt!

## Overview
This app allows you to take environmental data and turn it into a quilt pattern! Our app provides a unique medium to visualize environmental data. Choose one of the pre-loaded datasets in our app, or upload your own, determine how you would like your data to be displayed on your quilt, chronologically or one year is represented by one row, refine the date range of data that your quilt will include, select how large of a quilt you would like to make, pick a quantity of colors and color scheme for your quilt, and boom! You will be presented with an output where you can view your environmental data quilt design, telling you how many yards of each fabric color you will need to construct your quilt!

## Purpose
Our Environmental Data Quilt App aims to transform complex environmental datasets into tangible, artistic quilt creations. By merging data science with textile arts, our app seeks to make environmental data more accessible and engaging to a broader audience, helping to foster a deeper understanding of and connection to environmental issues. Our app can also be used to reveal trends and patterns that might be overlooked in traditional graphs and charts.

## Key Functions & Features
Use Pre-loaded or Custom Datasets:
- Choose from several built-in datasets sourced from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, or upload your own .csv file to personalize your quilt with data that matters to you.
Flexible Date Range Selection:
- Narrow or expand the timeframe of the dataset to reflect seasonal patterns, long-term trends, or specific historical periods in your quilt design.
Multiple Layout Options:
- Select how the data is arranged on the quilt:
    - Chronological layout: Tiles flow through time continuously.
    - Year-row layout: Each row in the quilt represents one year of data.
Customizable Color Schemes:
- Tailor the appearance of your quilt by selecting the number of distinct colors and choosing from several color palettes. Options are designed to balance visual aesthetics with clear data representation.
Quilt Size & Block Configuration:
- Specify the overall quilt dimensions and the number of data blocks, allowing for small wall hangings or full-size bed quilts.
Fabric Calculator:
- Automatically generates yardage requirements for each fabric color based on your quilt design, helping bridge the gap between digital visualization and physical construction.
Real-Time Preview:
- View a dynamic rendering of your quilt pattern as you make selections. Instantly see how different datasets, date ranges, and styles affect the final design.
