## Environmental Data Quilt!

This app is designed to take environmental data, either the default datasets or one input by the user, and create a colorful quilt pattern based on the data at hand. The UI includes four tabs that each have their own purpose.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
